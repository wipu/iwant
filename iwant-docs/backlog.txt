+ As a @developer I want this backlog on the @website so it serves as a simple status, feature and plan documentation

+ As a @developer I want to start using iwant as soon as possible on the @cli level
  + stage 0: "as shell user i want to use iwant"
  + stage 1: "as iwant user i want to use iwant on iwant"
  + website (static) refresh, deploy and tag
  + implement the simplest possible bootstrap for generating a descript document
  * possibly no java needed at this stage

+ As a @developer I want to be able to drive the @cli by documentation, starting from step zero
  + use descript
  + publish

+ As a @developer I want all error lines shown in the descript document
  * Only the second line of the error message about missing MAGICHEADER is shown
  + don't echo > /dev/stderr but >> /dev/stderr, because descript redirects to a _file_

+ As a @buildscriptauthor I want an error message if and only if I try to start using iwant on an invalid workspace definition

+ As a @buildscriptuser I want a list of targets defined in the workspace
  * iwant/as-X-developer/list-of/targets
  * flat target namespace

+ As a @buildscriptuser I want the shell target scripts updated when I request a list of targets

+ As a @buildscriptauthor I want to define a target file with constant string content and get a path to it

+ As a @buildscriptauthor I want that my changes to the workspace definition are effective automatically (automatic compilation)
  + this not only works during as-iwant-user/to-use-iwant-on

+ As a @buildscriptuser I want a fresh java classes directory even if its sources have been touched

+ As a @buildscriptauthor and @buildscriptuser I want fresh java classes even if its dependencies have been touched

+ As a @buildscriptauthor and @buildscriptuser I want to get a junit test result as path, be it failure or success
  + path to stdout always, error notification to stderr

= Planned
#################################################################

- As a @buildscriptauthor I want to be able to define tests for my workspace definition so if I break it iwant won't use it
  * this is essential for bootstrapping

- As a @developer I want iwant itself compiled with its workspace definition and tested with it so that I can bootstrap the whole tool, tested and working
  * if iwant gets later split into submodules, include only essentials here

- As a @buildscriptuser I want to see a non-empty build plan for a missing file with constant string content

- As a @buildscriptuser I want to see an empty build plan for an uptodate constant file
  * delegate uptodate logic away so this story stays simple

- As a @buildscriptuser I want to see an non-empty build plan for a target whose definition has changed
  * TODO what java files need to be checked, and timestamp only or content?

- As a @buildscriptauthor I want an error message if I refer to a java classes directory with a missing source
  * in the tutorial, call these test classes, to maintain the red-green cycle later
  + done but untested and undefined details

- As a @buildscriptuser I want an error message if I refer to a java classes directory of uncompilable sources
  + done but untested and undefined details

- As a @buildscriptuser I want immediate answer to a reference to a java classes directory that is newer than its sources

- As a @buildscriptuser I want a path only for the requested test result, not test results possibly dependend on
  * fail if a dep fails, without showing any path

#################################################################
= Story sketches, to be evaluated and or rewritten
#################################################################

- As a @buildscriptuser I want iwant to refresh targets automatically in parallel and letting me define the number of threads to use
  - TODO on commandline, in a conf file, something else or all of them?
  - TODO automatic detection of cpu count and using it for a good default?

- As a @buildscriptauthor I want to declare some targets single-threaded so targets depending on it get never refreshed in parallel
  * e.g. for tests that need the display, a certain shared sql table area or some other shared resource

- As a @buildscriptuser I want targets refreshed in an order that tries to find cumulative problems as early as possible
  * meaning targets that are most depended on are built first
    so if they have problems, their dependencies probably need
    to be refreshed again anyway
  * if equal, recurse into targets depending on them

- As a @buildscriptauthor I want iwant to use some non-default package for my workspace definition class and iwant still to be able to auto-detect the source directory location
  * read the package declaration from the java file to deduce where the src root is
  + now as-iwant-user/to-use-iwant-on requires all data as cli arguments
    so this story no more makes sense
