+ As a @developer I want this backlog on the @website so it serves as a simple status, feature and plan documentation

- As a @developer I want to start using iwant as soon as possible on the @cli level
  + stage 0: "as shell user i want to use iwant"
  + stage 1: "as iwant user i want to use iwant on iwant"
  + website (static) build and deploy
  - implement the simplest possible bootstrap for generating a descript document
  * possibly no java needed at this stage

- As a @developer I want to be able to drive the @cli by documentation, starting from step zero
  - use descript
  - publish
