- As a @developer I want this backlog on the @website so it serves as a simple status, feature and plan documentation

- As a @developer I want to start using iwant as soon as possible on the @cli level
  - implement the simplest possible bootstrap for generating a descript document
  * possibly no java needed at this stage

- As a @developer I want to be able to drive the @cli by documentation, starting from step zero
  - use descript
  - publish
