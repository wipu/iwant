  + stage 1: "as iwant user i want to use iwant on iwant"
  + website (static) build and deploy
  + implement the simplest possible bootstrap for generating a descript document

- As a @buildscriptauthor I want an error message if and only if I try to start using iwant on an invalid workspace definition

- As a @buildscriptauthor I want that my changes to the workspace definition are effective automatically (automatic compilation)

- As a @buildscriptauthor I want an error message if I refer to a java classes directory with a missing source
  * in the tutorial, call these test classes, to maintain the red-green cycle later

- As a @buildscriptuser I want an error message if I refer to a java classes directory of uncompilable sources

- As a @buildscriptuser I want a fresh java classes directory even if its sources have been touched

- As a @buildscriptuser I want immediate answer to a reference to a java classes directory that is newer than its sources
