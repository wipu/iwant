# Contributing to iwant

So, you want to contribute to iwant. Excellent!

Just do it using your best judgement. If your contribution isn't perfectly usable as such, it's still better than no contribution at all, and can be improved on.

If you contribute code in a pull request, please organize imports and format all code using the eclipse settings generated by the build.
Try to remember this before each commit.

Oh, and zero warnings by eclipse. (In the future other static analysis will probably also have this rule.)

Whenever possible and feasible, please accompany the feature/fix with tests that pass if and only if the feature/fix works. (Maybe even let the tests drive your design.)

Don't hesitate to ask for help.

More instructions will be added here later, as seen necessary.
